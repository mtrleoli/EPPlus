# EPPlus.Custom
EPPlus.Custom is based on EPPlus commit #d3c0492e73cac7377ca7f90eb78a7ae3b9fd4316, but several code blocks are commented out to make the IBM AppScan Source happy on the definitive issues.

The commented out code blocks related to CRC32 verification and PivotTable, so please be careful to use this library.
